# ABOUT THE MODEL
 There are 2 classes of the python program, one is the the main class "model.py" and "agentframework.py". 
 To run the model, use Spyder3.7 version .
 The model starts running by initialising the variables; Agents and the environment. 
 Secondly, the csv file "in.txt" which is used as the environment is read and initiated so agents can move, eat and share resources.
 Later on, the agents are enabled to animate by moving the agents in the environment until 100 iterations are reached.
 Graphical User Interface (GUI) is used to run the model
 
 # NB: Minor issues or an error may happen when the model is run in Command prompt.
